			This document works as a basic styleguide for the Fragmented
			Development 5000 layout, or FD5000 for short. It will have lots of
			different sections that cover various scenarios/aspects of the web
			site, and allow a one-stop shop for regression testing and all of
			that fun stuff.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's begin, shall we?

			<h1>Blog post</h1>
			<p>
				A post with text elements, as well as a code block, links,
				lists, and other general textual elements.

		<h1>The golden rule</h1>
		<p>If there is any single rule to running a GNUsocial instance, it's
		this: <strong>DO NOT EVER CHANGE YOUR URI</strong>. All of OStatus is
		built on your GNUsocial profile URI, and if you change it, everything
		falls down like a house of cards.</p>
		<p>For this reason, when I was able to implement HTTPS, I left it in
		mixed mode. My web server responded to both types of requests, and
		things were good. Sort of. More on that later.</p>
		<h2>Status of Micro.fragdev.com</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Subscriptions to FragDev users (except for users/subscriptions
				created after HTTPS was installed) are broken</li>
			<li>The realtime plugin is broken</li>
			<li>Older clients/platforms that don't recognize LetsEncrypt certs
				are broken</li>
		</ul>

        # Try fetching requests in the following order:
        # - Look for a static file at that address
